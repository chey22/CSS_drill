            <h2>Parable of the Lost Sheep</h2>
            <p>The parable of the lost sheep was told by Jesus when the Pharisees criticized Him for socializing with
                sinners. Through this story of compassion, Jesus revealed his rescue mission for sinners.
                <br><br>
                “Then <span class="oneWord">Jesus</span> told them this parable: ‘Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep
                and loses one of them. Does
                he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when
                he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors
                together and says, “Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.” I tell you that in the same way there
                will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who
                do not need to repent’” (Luke 15:3-7).
                <br><br>
                The parable of the lost sheep also illustrates Christ’s attitude toward the saved sinner. The parable
                gives no indication of the shepherd ever rebuking or chiding. Instead, he hoists the sheep upon his
                shoulders and takes it home. An adult sheep may weigh up to 125 pounds; it would be no small effort to
                carry one over the shoulder. For joy over finding that which was lost, the shepherd bears the
                discomfort. Likewise, Jesus bore the weight of our sins upon the cross.

            <h2>Prodigal Son Parable</h2>
            <p>The parable of the prodigal son is one of the greatest love stories ever told - a story filled with mercy
                and grace. It is a parable of how God views us and how we can choose to repent and turn to God or reject
                him. You will read in the Bible verses below about a father and two sons. While the older son stayed
                home and worked hard for his father, the younger son ran away with his inheritance and spend it on
                foolish things. Finding himself alone, working as a slave for food, and having to live with pigs, the
                younger son returns home begging to work for his father. The father welcomes home his son with open arms
                and great compassion. The oldest son becomes very angry with his brother for coming back home and with
                his father for accepting him home. Discover how <span class="oneWord">God</span>, our loving Father, is
                waiting for us to repent and
                come to him! </p>

            <h2>The Resurrection of Jesus</h2>
            <p>Both the Old and the New Testament speak of the truth of the Jesus being raised from death - <span
                    class="oneWord">Jesus</span> testified of his resurrection before he died on the cross and his
                disciples witnessed his body after the resurrection. Below are the Bible verses and Scriptures that both
